# Load and Solar Profiles

## Load Profiles
Time-varying consumption using:
- Residential demand curves
- Peak morning and evening peaks

## Solar Profiles
- Standard 24-hour irradiance curve
- Noon peak injection
- Cloud variability optional

## Combined Effects
Reverse flow begins when:
Solar > Load at a given node → Voltage rise upstream.

# Problem Statement

Grid-tied rooftop solar causes reverse power flow in LV feeders.
This leads to:
- Voltage fluctuations
- Phase imbalance
- Node-specific voltage violations

This project builds a MATLAB/Simulink model to:
- Simulate 24-hour dynamic solar + load conditions
- Detect per-node voltage issues
- Evaluate mitigation strategies

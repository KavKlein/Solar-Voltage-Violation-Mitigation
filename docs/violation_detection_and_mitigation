# Violation Detection

Criteria:
- Sri Lankan LV tolerance: ±6%
- Node voltages monitored per phase

Algorithm:
1. Simulate 24 hours
2. Capture voltage per node per minute
3. Flag nodes exceeding thresholds
4. Produce violation map

Outputs:
- Violating nodes
- Violating hours
- Worst-case phases

# Mitigation Strategies

## Reactive Power Control (Inverters)
- PF adjustment
- Absorption to counteract rising voltage

## Network Balancing
- Phase reallocation
- Equal load sharing

## Conductor Upgrades
- Lower R/X → Reduced drop/rise

## Transformer Tap Optimization
Tap changer set to 3/4 based on simulation outcomes.
